# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced Cockpit Initialization with Spec-Kit and Constitution Setup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain — 1 marker present (see Notes)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- **One [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker remains**: How is spec-kit distributed — bundled inside Cockpit, fetched from a GitHub repo, or copied from Cockpit's own `.specify/` directory? This affects the install mechanism but not the user-facing experience described in the spec. The spec is otherwise complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify`.
