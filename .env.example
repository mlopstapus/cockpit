# Claude Cockpit Environment Configuration
# Copy this to .env and update values for your setup

# Database Password (for PostgreSQL in docker-compose)
DB_PASSWORD=cockpit-dev-password

# Debug Mode
DEBUG=false

# Path to local repositories (where your repos are cloned)
REPOS_PATH=$HOME/repos

# Path to browse for projects (mounted into container at /projects)
# The folder picker in the UI starts here. Defaults to $HOME.
PROJECTS_PATH=$HOME

# Service Port Configuration
# These ports must not conflict with other services on your system
# Default alternative ports (when primary ports are in use):
#
# PostgreSQL:       localhost:5433 (internal: 5432)
# FastAPI Backend:  localhost:8001 (internal: 8000)
# React Frontend:   localhost:3001 (internal: 3000, Docker build)
# Vite Dev Server:  localhost:5173 (alternative: 3001)
# Nginx HTTP:       localhost:8080 (internal: 80)
# Nginx HTTPS:      localhost:8443 (internal: 443)
#
# To use different ports, edit docker-compose.yml directly.
# The development override (docker-compose.override.yml) uses ports 8001, 5173, 3001, 5433.

# Notes:
# - DB_PASSWORD: Change this in production
# - REPOS_PATH: Should contain subdirectories for each repo (opero, laddr, smartr, etc.)
# - DATABASE_URL is constructed automatically: postgresql://cockpit:$DB_PASSWORD@postgres:5432/cockpit
# - For development, run: docker-compose up
# - For production, run: docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up (skips overrides)
