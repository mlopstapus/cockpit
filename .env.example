PROFILES_DIR=/home/claude/.claude-profiles

# Directory to browse for projects (path inside container)
BROWSE_ROOT=/repos

# ===== Frontend =====
# API URL that the frontend connects to
# For local development: http://localhost:8001
# For remote (Tailscale): http://<your-nuc-tailscale-ip>:8001
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8001

# ===== Docker Volumes =====
# Your home directory path for mounting Claude profiles and repos
# Examples: /home/ben-anderson, /Users/yourname, /root
# This gets mounted as volumes so the backend can access your local files

# ===== Setup Instructions =====
# 1. Make sure ~/.claude-profiles exists with your Claude account profiles
# 2. Make sure ~/repos exists and contains your project directories (opero, laddr, etc.)
# 3. Update VITE_API_URL if connecting from a different machine (Tailscale)
# 4. Run: docker-compose up --build
#
# The container will mount:
#   - $HOME/.claude-profiles → /home/claude/.claude-profiles (read-only)
#   - $HOME/.claude → /home/claude/.claude (read-only)
#   - $HOME/repos → /repos (read-only)
